<br>was between France, Prussia and England. It was the
<br>last battle in the Napoleonic war. In the war there were
<br>times in which either the British and Prussians or the
<br>French could have one. But due to a few blundering
<br>errors and a good deal of luck the Coalition managed to
<br>win a decisive victory against Napoleon.&nbsp;</p>

                    <li><strong>Napoleon's escape from Elba.</strong> Napoleon 
Bonaparte the great emperor and conqueror of Europe had been defeated in the hands of the sixth coalition. In the terms of the surrender he was to abdicate (give up his throne) and go on exile to Elba. Elba is an island near enough to Italy. It was a far cry from Napoleon's palace in France. But having sensed that the Bourbons (The Bourbons where the new family of the monarch) were very disliked by the French people (since of course all French people hate Monarchies and anything to do with it and they had fought a revolution to get it out of the way). He conspired to go back to France and reclaim his throne.</li>
                    <li><strong>The state of the Coalition's alliance.</strong> Prior to the
 forming of the coalition that had beaten Napoleon in the Battle of Leipzig and at first looked like there would be long term peace, there had been a lot of countries switching sides. Whether they were forced to like the Prussians or to some degree on there own incentive such as Russia it was almost absurd and really hard to remember whether a country in one particular time was with Napoleon or against him. The fact and point I am trying to make is that the the sixth coalition was not formed since Britain and Russia liked each other but because they both hated Napoleon. In the post war talks the Coalition was to preoccupied with debating over Napoleon's exile to Elba than actually taking an eye on him.
This led to Napoleon having an almost frighteningly
easy return trip to France.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>The third and final cause of the Hundred Days
 Campaign and thus the battle of Waterloo is that France was in a way <strong>sore on their defeat</strong> to the coalition. They had been invaded some accounts say that they many villages had been pillaged but most historians diagram. But most of all especially for the Grande Armee of France is that a Monarchy in the Bourbons had been restored. All that they had fought for was ruined. Even if Napoleon did self proclaim him to be the emperor of France he was nonetheless a very capable general and he had created an empire. Support for Napoleon was far more than the support for their monarchy.</li>

                            As you can see in the armies total strength above the
 Prussians and British had more men combined against Napoleon but they had less when they were on their own. Thus, <strong>Napoleon's plan</strong> was to try and beat the British in Waterloo and to then beat the Prussians. The problem is that this depended on the Prussians and British army to not link up. To stop this from happening Napoleon sent Marshal Grouchy with a small force to harass the Prussians.</p>

                            Wellington's Plan was the opposite. He aimed to <strong>hold off the French</strong> until the Prussians arrived. To do this he fortified three main positions in front of his army. These positions were La haye Sainte, Hougoumont and Papelotte. Each of these three positions were a problem to
 Napoleon. Hougoumont and Papelotte secured Wellington's flanks (If an opponent takes you flanks you run the risk of being surrounded) and La haye Sainte was right in the center of the Battlefield. Also Wellington was able to conceal most of his army behind a hill so he can sprite the French later.</p>

                        <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The first major confrontation between the French and
<br>British would be when Napoleon sent a few brigades to
<br>attack the fortified Hougoumont. Since this was at the
<br>flank of Wellington's army Napoleon knew this was a
<br>key point and if he can just take it, victory would be his.
<br>The French charge at Hougoumont almost worked. In
<br>fact the French almost got past the front gate and that
<br>would have been it for the British. But the British troops
courageously fought off the French out of the gates and they were&nbsp;able to close the gate. Later Wellington stated that
"<em>the success of the battle turned upon closing the gates
at Hougoumont</em>".</p>

                        <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Though up to this point the British were doing quite well,
Wellington had thrown a bit too much troops to defend
Hougoumont. He famously said "<em>Either nightfall or the
Prussians must come if we are to win</em>". When both he and Napoleon saw an army of men neither of the men
knew who they were as they were too far to tell. Was it
Marshall Grouchy or General Blucher? Both knew that
this would decide the battle's outcome and perhaps the
war itself. Then news came. The Prussians had arrived.
Wellington was delighted. Napoleon on the other hand
said to Ney to tell his men that Grouchy had arrived.
This was to prevent the French morale from dropping.
As Napoleon once said "<em>in war, morale is everything</em>".&nbsp;<br></p>

had not immediately joined the battle and there was a
long way to go for the Prussians that he could win the
battle. He sent some of his reserves to face Blucher's
army. He then ordered the infantry to march in columns
(rows and rows of men quite tightly packed together). Most of them were supposed to attack La haye Sainte
and the few others to relieve the men fighting to capture
Hougoumont.</p>

<br>French. While individually the British would win a one on
one fight with the French cavalry, they did not attack as
a group really well. Even Wellington said "<em>Our officers of
cavalry have acquired a trick of galloping at everything.
They never consider the situation, never think of
manoeuvring before an enemy, and never keep back or
provide a reserve</em>."
The Scots are said to have made the bulk of the cavalry
charge and they were able to a certain degree break the
French line. The problem began when the British
Cavalry advanced too far into the French army...</p>

<br>French line, the French cavalry set out to attack and
<br>capture the cavalry of the British. Just like most of the
<br>events that took place in Waterloo this only partially
<br>worked. The French did take out a good many of the
<br>British Cavalry but there were still a lot of British men
<br>who were able to retreat to their line.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Close to 4 pm Ney seemed to have notice the
British to retreat. Seeing this Ney decided to try and go
out for personal glory. He gathered a large cavalry force
to try and take out the British.
When Ney did this he committed two mortal sins.
<br>1. The British were <strong>not</strong> retreating but were hiding
<br>behind a hill.
<br>2. The more important sin he committed was when he
<br><strong>only used his cavalry</strong> in the charge.
<br>When the French cavalry arrived the British formed into
<br><strong>anti-cavalry squares </strong>used to stop cavalry units right in
their tracks. Squares consisted of many men forming an
outer square with their bayonets out while people in the
middle would fire at the frightened horses. This
<br>movement demolished the French cavalry and Ney was
<br>forced to retreat. This in my opinion was one of the main
reasons the French lost.<br>Eventually the French after many attempts were able to
capture La haye Sainte at 6.30 pm but it was too late. At 4.00 pm the Prussians had&nbsp;started to attack <strong>Placenoit </strong>(a town at the French rear).<strong>&nbsp;</strong>This forced
Napoleon to commit more men to face the French.&nbsp;<br></p>

</h4>

                        <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Realising that almost all hope was lost Napoleon had
<br>one last trick up his sleeve. He was going to release the
<br>French old guard into the mix. These were veterans of
<br>war; they were the finest soldiers of Europe. But even
<br>they could not could not break the British line. It was too
late for them. There is speculation on what would have
happened if the French old guard had been put into
battle earlier.
When the French old guard could not break the British
line news spread around the French army saying "<em>La
Garde recule. Sauve qui peut!</em>" ("<em>The Guard is
retreating. Every man for himself!</em>").
At that time Placenoit was taken by the Prussians.&nbsp;<br>It was all over for Napoleon; he had lost Waterloo.&nbsp;</p>
