                <p class="mbr-text pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5">Waterloo is a famous battle fought in the year 1815. It
<br>was between France, Prussia and England. It was the
<br>last battle in the Napoleonic war. In the war there were
<br>times in which either the British and Prussians or the
<br>French could have one. But due to a few blundering
<br>errors and a good deal of luck the Coalition managed to
<br>win a decisive victory against Napoleon.&nbsp;</p>

                    <li><strong>Napoleon's escape from Elba.</strong> Napoleon 
Bonaparte the great emperor and conqueror of Europe had been defeated in the hands of the sixth coalition. In the terms of the surrender he was to abdicate (give up his throne) and go on exile to Elba. Elba is an island near enough to Italy. It was a far cry from Napoleon's palace in France. But having sensed that the Bourbons (The Bourbons where the new family of the monarch) were very disliked by the French people (since of course all French people hate Monarchies and anything to do with it and they had fought a revolution to get it out of the way). He conspired to go back to France and reclaim his throne.</li>
                    <li><strong>The state of the Coalition's alliance.</strong> Prior to the
 forming of the coalition that had beaten Napoleon in the Battle of Leipzig and at first looked like there would be long term peace, there had been a lot of countries switching sides. Whether they were forced to like the Prussians or to some degree on there own incentive such as Russia it was almost absurd and really hard to remember whether a country in one particular time was with Napoleon or against him. The fact and point I am trying to make is that the the sixth coalition was not formed since Britain and Russia liked each other but because they both hated Napoleon. In the post war talks the Coalition was to preoccupied with debating over Napoleon's exile to Elba than actually taking an eye on him.
This led to Napoleon having an almost frighteningly
easy return trip to France.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>The third and final cause of the Hundred Days
 Campaign and thus the battle of Waterloo is that France was in a way <strong>sore on their defeat</strong> to the coalition. They had been invaded some accounts say that they many villages had been pillaged but most historians diagram. But most of all especially for the Grande Armee of France is that a Monarchy in the Bourbons had been restored. All that they had fought for was ruined. Even if Napoleon did self proclaim him to be the emperor of France he was nonetheless a very capable general and he had created an empire. Support for Napoleon was far more than the support for their monarchy.</li>
